In this research project, we explore a new problem of synthesizing time lapse videos depicting the creation of paintings.

Below, we use the [tipiX](https://github.com/adalca/tipiX) interactive visualization tool for some time lapses. The first row shows real time lapses created by artists, the second row shows videos synthesized by the <i>visual deprojection</i> baseline, and the third row shows videos synthesized by our method. To use the tipiX tool, click on the image to pause/start the autoplay feature, and move your mouse from left to right to move through each time lapse.
